# Civic SIP Plugin - Ruby
[The Bounty](https://cdp.civic.com/)

### Overview
The Civic SIP plugin is the most common method of integrating Civic into a partner website. The plugin interfaces with Civic's request APIs to create and display the QR codes and deep links necessary for users to share their data. To see the integration in action, [sign up for your developer account](https://integrate.civic.com/login). You'll need one anyways!

Civic already has plugin support available for Javascript, [PHP](https://github.com/civicteam/civic-cdp-template), and [Java](https://github.com/civic-community/civic-sip-api-java). These libraries may be useful as reference for your Ruby implementation.

### Deliverables
* Your Ruby plugin should fully support the Civic Hosted flow outlined in [our docs](https://docs.civic.com/#CivicHostedoption).
* A ReadMe useable by both interested partners and potential future contributors (see and update [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)). ReadMe must include getting started steps for partners new to Civic. See the [PHP ReadMe](https://github.com/blockvis/civic-sip-php/blob/master/README.md) for an excellent example.
* Unit tests to ensure the future health and stability of the project.
* A proof-of-concept page showing a working user sign in to close out the bounty.
